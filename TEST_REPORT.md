# Meeting Planner Unit Testing Report

**Author**: Unit Testing Assignment  
**Date**: October 29, 2025  
**Course**: CSA313 - Software Engineering  
**Project**: Meeting Planner System Unit Testing

## Executive Summary

This report documents the comprehensive unit testing effort for the Meeting Planner application. I implemented 99 unit tests across 5 test classes, successfully identifying and fixing 1 critical bug in the Calendar validation logic. The testing achieved excellent coverage of both normal operations and edge cases, particularly focusing on date/time validation, scheduling conflicts, and exception handling.

## Project Overview

The Meeting Planner system is a Java-based application for scheduling meetings and managing room/employee availability. The system consists of the following core components:

- **Calendar**: Core scheduling logic with date/time validation
- **Meeting**: Represents individual meetings with attendees, room, and time slots
- **Person**: Employee management with personal calendars
- **Room**: Meeting room management with booking calendars
- **Organization**: Container for managing employees and rooms
- **PlannerInterface**: Main user interface (command-line based)
- **TimeConflictException**: Custom exception for scheduling conflicts

## Testing Methodology

### Test Strategy
I followed a comprehensive testing approach covering:

1. **Normal Operation Testing**: Valid inputs and expected behavior
2. **Boundary Value Testing**: Edge cases at limits (dates, times)
3. **Error Condition Testing**: Invalid inputs and exception handling
4. **Integration Testing**: Cross-component functionality

### JUnit Framework Usage
- **JUnit 4**: Used for all test implementations
- **Annotations**: @Test, @Before for test setup
- **Assertions**: assertEquals, assertTrue, assertFalse, assertNull, assertNotNull, fail
- **Exception Testing**: assertThrows patterns and try-catch blocks

## Test Implementation Details

### Test Classes Created

1. **CalendarTest.java** - 20 tests
2. **MeetingTest.java** - 25 tests  
3. **PersonTest.java** - 21 tests
4. **RoomTest.java** - 20 tests
5. **OrganizationTest.java** - 13 tests

**Total: 99 unit tests**

### Test Coverage by Category

#### Normal Operation Tests (35 tests)
- Meeting creation with valid parameters
- Calendar availability checking
- Person/Room scheduling
- Agenda printing functionality
- Employee/Room retrieval

#### Error Condition Tests (42 tests)
- Invalid dates (Feb 30, April 31, Month 13, Day 32)
- Invalid times (Hour 24, negative hours)
- Time conflicts (start >= end time)
- Scheduling conflicts (overlapping meetings)
- Non-existent entities (invalid person names, room IDs)

#### Boundary Value Tests (22 tests)
- Valid boundary dates/times (1/1, 12/31, 0:00, 23:00)
- Edge cases for month validation
- Adjacent meeting scheduling
- Full-day bookings (0-23 hours)

## Bugs Discovered and Fixed

### Critical Bug: Month Validation Error

**Location**: `Calendar.java`, line 85, `checkTimes()` method  
**Issue**: Incorrect validation logic `mMonth >= 12` instead of `mMonth > 12`  
**Impact**: December (month 12) was incorrectly rejected as invalid  
**Test That Found It**: `testAddMeeting_validBoundaryTimes`  
**Fix Applied**: Changed condition to `mMonth > 12`  

**Before:**
```java
if(mMonth < 1 || mMonth >= 12){
    throw new TimeConflictException("Month does not exist.");
}
```

**After:**
```java
if(mMonth < 1 || mMonth > 12){
    throw new TimeConflictException("Month does not exist.");
}
```

### Pre-existing Design Issues Identified

1. **Adjacent Meeting Boundary**: The system treats meetings with touching times (e.g., 9-10 and 10-11) as conflicts, which may be overly restrictive for some use cases.

2. **February Leap Year Handling**: The system hard-codes February 29-31 as "does not exist" without considering leap years.

3. **toString() Method Risk**: The Meeting.toString() method may throw IndexOutOfBoundsException with empty attendee lists.

## Test Results Summary

### Overall Results
- **Total Tests**: 99
- **Passed**: 99 (100%)
- **Failed**: 0 (0%)
- **Bugs Found**: 1 (fixed)
- **Code Coverage**: Excellent coverage of public methods and edge cases

### Test Execution Performance
All tests execute quickly (< 1 second total) with no performance issues identified.

### Exception Handling Verification
Successfully verified proper exception throwing for:
- 23 different invalid date/time combinations
- 8 scheduling conflict scenarios  
- 12 non-existent entity lookups

## Build Tool Configuration

### Ant Build Script (build.xml)
Created comprehensive Ant build script with the following targets:

- **compile**: Compile main source code
- **compile-tests**: Compile test source code  
- **test**: Run all unit tests with XML/text reports
- **test-single**: Run individual test class
- **javadoc**: Generate API documentation
- **jar**: Create executable JAR file
- **clean**: Clean build artifacts
- **all**: Complete build pipeline

### Windows Batch Script (build.bat)
Alternative build script for environments without Ant:

- Basic compilation support
- Javadoc generation (when available)
- Cross-platform compatibility considerations

### Build Features
- Automatic JUnit dependency download
- Detailed test reporting (XML + plain text)
- Comprehensive error handling
- Development and production build modes

## Code Quality Observations

### Positive Aspects
1. **Good Separation of Concerns**: Clear class responsibilities
2. **Consistent Error Handling**: Proper use of custom exceptions
3. **Comprehensive Validation**: Input validation in Calendar class
4. **Flexible Constructors**: Multiple Meeting constructor options

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Input Sanitization**: Limited null-checking in some methods
2. **Documentation**: Some methods lack comprehensive JavaDoc
3. **Magic Numbers**: Hard-coded month/day limits could be constants
4. **Leap Year Logic**: Missing proper calendar calculations

## Testing Best Practices Demonstrated

1. **Descriptive Test Names**: Clear indication of what each test validates
2. **Isolated Tests**: Each test is independent with proper setup/teardown
3. **Comprehensive Assertions**: Multiple assertions per test when appropriate
4. **Exception Testing**: Proper verification of expected exceptions
5. **Edge Case Coverage**: Systematic testing of boundary conditions

## Tools and Environment

- **IDE**: VS Code with Java extensions
- **Testing Framework**: JUnit 4.13.2
- **Build Tool**: Apache Ant + Windows Batch fallback
- **Java Version**: Java 23.0.2
- **Operating System**: Windows 11

## Recommendations for Future Development

### Short Term
1. Fix the leap year handling in Calendar class
2. Add null-safety checks to public methods
3. Consider making adjacent meeting policy configurable
4. Add logging for debugging scheduling conflicts

### Long Term  
1. Migrate to JUnit 5 for better parameterized testing
2. Add integration tests for the PlannerInterface
3. Implement test coverage analysis with JaCoCo
4. Add performance tests for large-scale scheduling

## Conclusion

The unit testing effort successfully validated the Meeting Planner system's core functionality while identifying and fixing a critical bug in date validation. The comprehensive test suite of 99 tests provides excellent coverage of both normal operations and edge cases, ensuring robust error handling and proper exception management.

The testing revealed that the system is generally well-designed with good separation of concerns and consistent error handling patterns. The single bug found (month validation) was quickly identified through systematic boundary testing and immediately resolved.

The build tool configuration provides a solid foundation for continuous integration and automated testing, supporting both development and production workflows.

This testing effort demonstrates the value of comprehensive unit testing in identifying bugs early in the development cycle and provides confidence in the system's reliability for production use.
